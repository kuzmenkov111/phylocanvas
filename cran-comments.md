## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

*  Changed the descriptiono to be more informative. It now reads: Create interactive phylogenetic trees using the phylocanvas JS library.

* Added a link the the upstream library, http://phylocanvas.org/

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.3.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.


## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
